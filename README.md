An Active A seemingly real-time program that offers global real-time data.

## Documentation


Introducing My project, a painstakingly designed weather application that utilizes state-of-the-art technologies. With the help of Tailwind CSS, React.js, and the sophisticated Meterial UI toolkit, it provides a flawless weather experience.✨ I also use Redux integration to handle states, React Hook for seamless theme transitions and a flexible Table menu, and OpenCloud APIs to power clever locations autocomplete suggestions.


## Features

- Current Weather Conditions: Provides access to current weather conditions, including temperature, precipitation, wind speed, UV index, and more.
- Forecast: Access a 24-hour forecast at your fingertips.
- Command Menu: Toggle the command menu with a keyboard shortcut (Shortcut: Command+J) for quick access to search functionality.
- Seamless Theme Transitions: Switch between themes (Shortcut: T) effortlessly thanks to React Hooks, ensuring a visually pleasing and accessible interface.
- Interactive Map: Navigate a dynamic map with customizable tiles, including temperature (°C), precipitation intensity (mm/s), wind speed and direction (m/s), relative humidity (%), cloudiness (%), and atmospheric pressure (hPa).
